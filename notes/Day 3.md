Task No. :- 3

In this task, I downloaded the Dataset from Kaggle about "Sales Data". In that, i created 6-8 different Charts and Graphs. It was quite a challenging task for me as I'm not familier with Tableau/Power BI. But being used to making dashboards, I quickly adapted to Tableau and tried to make a dashboard as good as I can make.Making PPT was a bit tricky because it took more than expected time and i got lost and confused in it but somehow managed to complete it. I hope you will like my work. Thank you Team Elevate Labs for this opportunity and helping me to cater the challenges and making myself believe in me to develop a problem-solving habit through these Tasks.
